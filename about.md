Hi! 👋 I am a research assistant in CITI at Academia Sinica, working with Prof. [Jun-Cheng Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3x9KITUAAAAJ&hl=en){: .text-link }. Previously, I served as a research assistant at the Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica, under the supervision of Prof. [Chun-Shien Lu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3iOHvUAAAAAJ&hl){: .text-link } and co-advised by Prof. [Chia-Mu Yu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dW4W4isAAAAJ&hl){: .text-link } during this time. 

I obtained two M.Sc. degrees: one in Computer Science from National Chengchi University, Taiwan (advised by Prof. [Raylin Tso](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=go8aLaQAAAAJ&hl){: .text-link }), and another in Electrical Engineering & Computer Science from Kanazawa University, Japan (advised by Prof. [Masahiro Mambo](https://iseclab.ec.t.kanazawa-u.ac.jp/en/mambo/index.html){: .text-link }). I received my B.Sc. degree in Information Management from Chang Gung University, Taiwan.

<span style="color: #DC143C; font-weight: bold;">I am looking for a Ph.D. position. I will be thrilled if you are interested in my profile. Feel free to contact me by email!</span>


## 🔬 Research Interest

My primary research interests focus on developing **trustworthy and reliable AI systems** to advance technology and address social challenges. I aim to ensure **robustness, privacy, fairness, and interpretability of AI** when applied across various domains.

* Generative AI: diffusion models, multimodal models, large language models.
* Trustworthy AI: adversarial robustness, security, privacy-preserving techniques.
* Others: copyright protection, robust generalization, safety alignment.
